DAILY NOTES

1. 15/12/2025

	A. Create GitHub account
		username=vaishnavigiri1210

	B. Installation of docker for creating same virtual environment on any system
 		what is docker??
 			Docker creates its OWN environment
 			GitHub does NOT store environments
 			Docker creates everything at runtime
 		need of requirements.txt??
 			tells about libraries
 			Install EXACTLY these libraries with EXACT versions
 			Same environment on any system

 	C. creates first project

 		first\_docker\_demo/
 			├── app.py
 			├── requirements.txt
 			└── Dockerfile

	D. uploaded on GitHub
		commands:
 			git init
 			git add .
 			git status
 			git commit -m "commited msg"
 			git branch -m main
 			git remote add origin https://github.com/vaishnavigiri1210/Internship.git
 			git push -u origin main
		Whenever you change something:
 			git add .
 			git commit -m "updated code"
 			git push

	A. Python Basics

		Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.
 		Basic Syntax:
 			print("Hello, World!")
 		Comments:
 			# This is a single-line comment
 			"""
 			This is a
 			multi-line comment
 			"""

		Variables and Data Types:
			Python doesn’t need explicit type declaration.
				x = 10          # integer
				y = 3.14        # float
				name = "Vaishnavi"  # string
				is\_active = True   # Boolean

		Operators:
	 			Arithmetic: + - \* / % // \*\*
	 			Comparison: == != > < >= <=
	 			Logical:
						and → True if both conditions are True
						or → True if any condition is True
						not → True if condition is False
	 			Assignment: =, +=, -=, \*=, /=

	B. Decision Making

		Decision making means choosing between different paths in a program based on a condition.

		1. if Statement
			Executes a block of code only if the condition is True.
				Syntax:
					if condition:
						# code to execute
				Example:
					age = 18
					if age >= 18:
						print("You are an adult")

		2. if-else Statement
			Executes one block if True, another block if False.
				Syntax:
					if condition:
    					# code if True
					else:
    					# code if False
				Example:
					age = 16
					if age >= 18:
						print("You can vote")
					else:
						print("Too young to vote")

		3. if-elif-else Statement
			Used when there are multiple conditions.
			Syntax:
				if condition1:
					# code
				elif condition2:
					# code
				else:
					# code

			Example:
				marks = 75
				if marks >= 90:
					print("Grade A")
				elif marks >= 75:
					print("Grade B")
				elif marks >= 50:
					print("Grade C")
				else:
					print("Fail")

		4. Nested if Statement
			if statement inside another if statement.
			Syntax:
				if condition1:
					if condition2:
						# code
			Example:
				num = 10
				if num > 0:
					if num % 2 == 0:
						print("Positive Even Number")
					else:
						print("Positive Odd Number")
				else:
					print("Negative Number")

	C. .gitignore file
		which can ignores while uploading on git
		it consists file path(relative) or file name
		mainly used for env folder because 
			Large Size
			Platform Dependency
			Redundant i.e. By running pip install -r requirements.txt, anyone can recreate the environment from scratch.
			Security Risks i.e.Virtual environments may contain system-specific paths, hidden files, or sensitive cache data.
		
		steps to install env
			1. run on terminal = py -m venv env
			2. Then activate env = env\Scripts\activate
				You should see:
					(env) PS C:\Users\Vaishnavi Giri\Desktop\@GPP\Internship>
			3. Install libraries
				pip install -r requirements.txt

	A. Loops in Python

		they allow developers to automate repetitive tasks, which saves time, reduces code redundancy, and makes programs more efficient and manageable. 
		4 types:

		1. while Loop
			Used when you don’t know the number of iterations, loop runs until a condition becomes False.
			Syntax:
				while condition:
					# code to execute
			Example:
				count = 0
				while count < 5:
					print(count)
					count += 1
		
		2. for Loop
			Used when you know the number of iterations.
			Syntax:
				for variable in sequence:
					# code to execute
			Example 1: Loop over a list
				fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
				for fruit in fruits:
					print(fruit)
			Example 2: Using range()
				for i in range(5):
					print(i)

		3.Nested Loops
			Loop inside another loop.
			Example:
			for i in range(1, 4):
				for j in range(1, 4):
					print(i, j)
	
	B.Control Statements in Python
		break → exits the loop immediately.
			for i in range(5):
				if i == 3:
					break
				print(i)

		continue → skips the current iteration and moves to next.

			for i in range(5):
				if i == 3:
					continue
				print(i)

		pass → does nothing, placeholder for future code.

			for i in range(5):
				pass

	C. Data Structures in Python

	| Data Structure | Ordered   | Mutable | Duplicates |
	| List           | ✅       | ✅       | ✅      |  []
	| Tuple          | ✅       | ❌       | ✅      |  ()
	| Set            | ❌       | ✅       | ❌      |	  
	| Dictionary     | ❌       | ✅       | Keys ❌ | Stores data in key : value pairs

	List Comprehension in Python
		List comprehension is a short and smart way to create a new list from an existing list using one line of code
