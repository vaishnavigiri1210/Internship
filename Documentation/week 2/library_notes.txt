    1. NumPy

        NumPy is a Python library.
        NumPy is short for "Numerical Python".
        NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
        It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
        NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

        Why Use NumPy?
            In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
            NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
            The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.
            Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

        Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?
            NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.
            This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.
            This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.

        Create a NumPy ndarray Object
            NumPy is used to work with arrays. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray.
            We can create a NumPy ndarray object by using the array() function.
            To create an ndarray, we can pass a list, tuple or any array-like object into the array() method, and it will be converted into an ndarray:

        Example
            Use a tuple to create a NumPy array:
            import numpy as np
            arr = np.array((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
            print(arr)
        
        Dimensions in Arrays
            A dimension in arrays is one level of array depth (nested arrays).
            nested array: are arrays that have arrays as their elements.

            1. 0-D Arrays
                0-D arrays, or Scalars, are the elements in an array. Each value in an array is a 0-D array.
                Example
                    Create a 0-D array with value 42
                    import numpy as np
                    arr = np.array(42)
                    print(arr)

            2. 1-D Arrays
                An array that has 0-D arrays as its elements is called uni-dimensional or 1-D array.
                These are the most common and basic arrays.
                Example
                    Create a 1-D array containing the values 1,2,3,4,5:
                    import numpy as np
                    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
                    print(arr)

            3. 2-D Arrays
                An array that has 1-D arrays as its elements is called a 2-D array.
                These are often used to represent matrix or 2nd order tensors.
                NumPy has a whole sub module dedicated towards matrix operations called numpy.mat
                Example
                    Create a 2-D array containing two arrays with the values 1,2,3 and 4,5,6:
                    import numpy as np
                    arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
                    print(arr)

            4. 3-D arrays
                An array that has 2-D arrays (matrices) as its elements is called 3-D array.
                These are often used to represent a 3rd order tensor.
                Example
                    Create a 3-D array with two 2-D arrays, both containing two arrays with the values 1,2,3 and 4,5,6:
                    import numpy as np
                    arr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]])
                    print(arr)

        Check Number of Dimensions?
            NumPy Arrays provides the ndim attribute that returns an integer that tells us how many dimensions the array have.
            Example
                Check how many dimensions the arrays have:
                import numpy as np
                a = np.array(42)
                b = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
                c = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
                d = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]])
                print(a.ndim)
                print(b.ndim)
                print(c.ndim)
                print(d.ndim)
        
        Higher Dimensional Arrays
            An array can have any number of dimensions.
            When the array is created, you can define the number of dimensions by using the ndmin argument.
            Example
            Create an array with 5 dimensions and verify that it has 5 dimensions:
            import numpy as np
            arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], ndmin=5)
            print(arr)
            print('number of dimensions :', arr.ndim)

        Access Array Elements
            Array indexing is the same as accessing an array element.
            You can access an array element by referring to its index number.
            The indexes in NumPy arrays start with 0, meaning that the first element has index 0, and the second has index 1 etc.
            Example
                Get the first element from the following array:
                import numpy as np
                arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
                print(arr[0])
            Get third and fourth elements from the following array and add them.
                import numpy as np
                arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
                print(arr[2] + arr[3])
            
        Access 2-D Arrays
            To access elements from 2-D arrays we can use comma separated integers representing the dimension and the index of the element.
            Think of 2-D arrays like a table with rows and columns, where the dimension represents the row and the index represents the column.
            Example
            Access the element on the first row, second column:
            import numpy as np
            arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])
            print('2nd element on 1st row: ', arr[0, 1])
        
            Access the element on the 2nd row, 5th column:
                import numpy as np
                arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])
                print('5th element on 2nd row: ', arr[1, 4])
            
        Access 3-D Arrays
            To access elements from 3-D arrays we can use comma separated integers representing the dimensions and the index of the element.
            Example
            Access the third element of the second array of the first array:
            import numpy as np
            arr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])
            print(arr[0, 1, 2])
        
        Negative Indexing
            Use negative indexing to access an array from the end.
            Example
            Print the last element from the 2nd dim:
            import numpy as np
            arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])
            print('Last element from 2nd dim: ', arr[1, -1])

        Slicing arrays
            Slicing in python means taking elements from one given index to another given index.
            We pass slice instead of index like this: [start:end].
            We can also define the step, like this: [start:end:step].
            If we don't pass start its considered 0
            If we don't pass end its considered length of array in that dimension
            If we don't pass step its considered 1
            Example
                Slice elements from index 1 to index 5 from the following array:
                import numpy as np
                arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
                print(arr[1:5])
            Note: The result includes the start index, but excludes the end index.
            Example
                Slice elements from index 4 to the end of the array:
                import numpy as np
                arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
                print(arr[4:])
            Example
                Slice elements from the beginning to index 4 (not included):
                import numpy as np
                arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
                print(arr[:4])

            Negative Slicing
                Use the minus operator to refer to an index from the end:
                Example
                    Slice from the index 3 from the end to index 1 from the end:
                    import numpy as np
                    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
                    print(arr[-3:-1])

            STEP
                Use the step value to determine the step of the slicing:
                Example
                    Return every other element from index 1 to index 5:
                    import numpy as np
                    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
                    print(arr[1:5:2])
                Example
                    Return every other element from the entire array:
                    import numpy as np
                    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
                    print(arr[::2])
            Slicing 2-D Arrays
                Example
                    From the second element, slice elements from index 1 to index 4 (not included):
                    import numpy as np
                    arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])
                    print(arr[1, 1:4])
                Note: Remember that second element has index 1.
                Example
                    From both elements, return index 2:
                    import numpy as np
                    arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])
                    print(arr[0:2, 2])
                Example
                    From both elements, slice index 1 to index 4 (not included), this will return a 2-D array:
                    import numpy as np
                    arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])
                    print(arr[0:2, 1:4])
        Data Types in NumPy
            NumPy has some extra data types
                and refer to data types with one character, like i for integers, u for unsigned integers etc.
                Below is a list of all data types in NumPy and the characters used to represent them.
                i - integer
                b - boolean
                u - unsigned integer
                f - float
                c - complex float
                m - timedelta
                M - datetime
                O - object
                S - string
                U - unicode string
                V - fixed chunk of memory for other type ( void )
            Checking the Data Type of an Array
                The NumPy array object has a property called dtype that returns the data type of the array:
                Example
                    Get the data type of an array object:
                    import numpy as np
                    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
                    print(arr.dtype)
                Example   
                    Get the data type of an array containing strings:
                    import numpy as np
                    arr = np.array(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'])
                    print(arr.dtype)
            Creating Arrays With a Defined Data Type
                We use the array() function to create arrays, this function can take an optional argument: 
                    dtype that allows us to define the expected data type of the array elements:
                Example
                    Create an array with data type string:
                    import numpy as np
                    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype='S')
                    print(arr)
                    print(arr.dtype)

                    For i, u, f, S and U we can define size as well.

                Example
                        Create an array with data type 4 bytes integer:
                        import numpy as np
                        arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype='i4')
                        print(arr)
                        print(arr.dtype)
