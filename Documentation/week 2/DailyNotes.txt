    A. Function in Python

        A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.
        Instead of writing the same code again and again, we put it inside a function and call it whenever needed.
        Function is defined using def
        Function must be called to execute
        A function can return multiple values
        A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
        A function can return data as a result.
        A function helps avoiding code repetition

        Function names follow the same rules as variable names in Python:
            A function name must start with a letter or underscore
            A function name can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores
            Function names are case-sensitive (myFunction and myfunction are different)
        
        Why use functions?
            To reduce code repetition
            To make code clean and readable
            Easy debugging and maintenance
            Divide a big program into small parts
        
        Syntax of Function
            def function_name(parameters):
                statements
                return value
                where:
                    def → keyword to define a function
                    function_name → name of the function
                    parameters → inputs (optional)
                    return → sends result back (optional)
        
        From a function's perspective:
            A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
            An argument is the actual value that is sent to the function when it is called.
        
        1. Built-in Functions:
            Already available in Python
            Examples:
                print()
                len()
                type()
        2. User-defined Functions:
                Created by the user
                def square(n):
                    return n * n

        3. Function with Default Arguments:
            def greet(name="User"):
                print("Hello", name)

            greet()
            greet("Vaishnavi")

        4. Function with Multiple Return Values:
            def calc(a, b):
                return a+b, a-b

            x, y = calc(10, 5)
            print(x, y)

        Python Decorators
            Decorators let you add extra behavior to a function, without changing the function's code.
            A decorator is a function that takes another function as input and returns a new function.
        
        Lambda Function in python
            A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
            A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
            
            Built in lambda function

            1. map()
                Purpose: Apply a function to each element of a sequence.
                Syntax
                    map(function, iterable)
            2. filter()
                Purpose: Select elements based on a condition.
                Syntax
                    filter(function, iterable)
            3. reduce()
                Purpose: Reduce a list to one single value.
                reduce() is present in functools module.
                Syntax
                    from functools import reduce
                    reduce(function, iterable)
            4. sorted()
                Purpose: Sort elements using custom logic.
            
        Recursion
            Recursion is when a function calls itself.
                
    B. Module in Python

        Module = Python file
        A module in Python is a file that contains Python code such as functions, variables, and classes.
        The file name ends with .py and can be reused in other programs using the import keyword.

        Why use Modules?
            Code reusability
            Better organization of large programs
            Easy maintenance
            Avoid writing same code again
        
        Types of Modules in Python
        
            1. Built-in Modules

                Already provided by Python

                Examples:
                    math → mathematical operations
                    random → generates random values
                    datetime → date and time handling
                    sys → system-related information  

            2. User-Defined Modules

                Modules created by the user
            
                Ways to Import Modules:
                    1. import module_name
                            import math
                            print(math.pi)

                    2. import module_name as alias
                            import math as m
                            print(m.sqrt(16))

                    3. from module import function
                            from math import sqrt
                            print(sqrt(36))

                    4. from module import *
                            from math import *
                            print(sin(0))

    C. Library in Python

        A library in Python is a collection of modules that provides ready-made functions, classes, and tools to perform specific tasks easily.
        Module = one file
        Library = collection of modules
        Library is a collection of modules
        Helps in faster development
        Can be built-in or external
        Imported using import
        A library in Python is a collection of modules that provides reusable code for specific tasks.
        1 file → module
        2 or more module files → library
        
        Why use Libraries?
            Saves time and effort
            No need to write code from scratch
            Makes programs powerful and efficient
            Widely used in industry & projects

        Types of Libraries in Python:

            1. Standard (Built-in) Libraries

                Already available with Python installation

                Examples:
                    math
                    random
                    datetime
                    sys
                    os

                Example:
                    import math
                    print(math.factorial(5))

            2. External (Third-Party) Libraries

                Need to be installed using pip

                Examples:

                    numpy → numerical computing
                    pandas → data analysis
                    matplotlib → data visualization
                    scikit-learn → machine learning
                    flask → web development

                Install example:
                    pip install numpy

                Use example:

                    import numpy as np
                    print(np.array([1, 2, 3]))

        Real-Life Example
            Library = Book
            Module = Chapter
            Function = Topic inside chapter
    
    D. Difference between function,module,library

        | Feature     | Function                            | Module             | Library                   |
        | ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
        | What is it? | Block of code                       | Single Python file | Collection of modules     |
        | Stored in   | Program or module                   | `.py` file         | Folder/package of modules |
        | Created by  | User                                | User / Python      | Python / User             |
        | Reusability | Only inside program (or via module) | Across programs    | Across programs           |
        | Example     | `def add(a,b)`                      | `mymodule.py`      | `math`, `random`          |

    E. What is __init__.py?

        __init__.py is a special Python file that tells Python:
            “This folder is a package (library)”

        It makes a folder importable
        __init__.py does not contain only constants
        it may be empty or contain import statements and optional variables.

    F. Type Hinted in Python
        Type hinted in Python means using type hints (type annotations) to specify the expected data types of variables, function parameters, and return values.

    G. __main__ in Python
        In Python, __main__ is used to check whether a Python file is being run directly or being imported as a module.
        Run code only when file is executed directly, not when imported
        __main__ is used to prevent code execution when a Python file is imported as a module.

        What is __name__?
            Every Python file has a built-in variable called __name__.
            If the file is run directly, __name__ is set to "__main__".
            If the file is imported, __name__ is set to the file name.

        Why use if __name__ == "__main__":?
            It allows you to:
            Run some code only when the file is executed directly
            Prevent that code from running when the file is imported
